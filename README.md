## USAGE

This is the demonstration of mapping function to fractal space. Under windows os, an easy way is to run `demo` in the current folder. A preprocessed[^footnote] data set is also included *for demonstration purpose only*. The date set is obtained from [UCI machine learning repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Molecular+Biology+%28Promoter+Gene+Sequences%29).

## COMPILE
The main procedure of mapping function is carried out in the mex file `cbr.cpp`. To compile it under different platform, run:
```
mex -v cbr.cpp
```

## NOTICE
This copy of code is for demonstration only.

[^footnote]: The symbols are converted into numerical.
